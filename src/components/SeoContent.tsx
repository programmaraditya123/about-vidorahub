        The Story Behind VidoraHub
      </h2>

      <p>
        VidoraHub began as an idea to build a creator-first video sharing
        platform where creators could publish content, grow communities, and
        maintain ownership of their audience relationships. The platform is
        being built from India with a focus on transparency, fairness, and
        long-term creator sustainability.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        As the creator economy continues to grow, many creators depend on
        unpredictable algorithms and platform-controlled monetization models.
        VidoraHub aims to provide an alternative — a video platform where
        discovery is driven by community engagement and creator trust.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        The vision of VidoraHub is to support creators across regions,
        languages, and communities by building infrastructure that enables
        independent digital storytelling and meaningful audience connections.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        VidoraHub is currently in its early development stage, focused on
        building the core platform experience for creators and viewers.
